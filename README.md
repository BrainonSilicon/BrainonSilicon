### Hi there 👋

I'm Sophia. I'm a Neuroscientist, researcher, and builder of many things. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - A PhD on memory, perception, and sensorimotor learning in Virtual Reality
  - The Ethical Research Guide with [The Turing Way](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-handbook-reproducible-data-science) 
  - A Co-created, [Citizen Science platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience) to better understand the relationship between sensory processing and autism.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Causal modeling for early stage interventions 
  - Probabilistic modeling to assess how we learn

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
	- [The Turing Way's](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) guides for reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science. 
	- An accessibility focused UX and Design System for the [AutSPACEs platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience). 
	- Workshops and Tooling that increases the accessibility of Open Science.

- 💬 I'm always looking to chat about open science, ethics, AI, VR/AR, or how to make the world a safer, kinder, and more accessible place 🗺️

### Hi there 👋

I'm Sophia. I'm a Neuroscientist, researcher, and builder of many things. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - Citizen Science and Open Research frameworks with the [AI for Multiple Long-Term Conditions](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-multiple-long-term-conditions-research-support-facility)research programme
  - A Co-created, [Citizen Science platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience) to better understand the relationship between sensory processing and autism.
  - [The Turing Way's](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) guides for reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Causal modeling for early stage interventions 
  - Probabilistic modeling to assess how we learn

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
	- An accessibility focused UX and Design System for the [AutSPACEs platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience). 
	- Workshops and Tooling that increases the accessibility of Open Science.
	- A [Glossary of Terms](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Glossary-of-Terms) for AI and Medical Science 

- 💬 I'm always looking to chat about open science, ethics, AI, VR/AR, or how to make the world a safer, kinder, and more accessible place 🗺️

- 📫 Send me an [email](mailto:ssmbatchelor@gmail.com) or [twitter DM](https://twitter.com/brainonsilicon) to get in touch.
